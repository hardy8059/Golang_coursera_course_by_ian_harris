# Golang_specialisation_coursera_course_by_ian_harris

This repo contains the assignments and quiz I cleared to complete the courses in Google Go Specialisation.
It has three courses:
  - Getting Started with Go
  - Functions, Methods and Interfaces in GO
  - Concurrency in Go
  
 It was a great learning experience and my favourite out of three was "Concurrency in GO".
